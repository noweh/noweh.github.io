# My portfolio

This portfolio project is more than just a showcase. It’s an experiment in simplicity, code, and creativity—a site that doesn’t hide behind flashy effects but lets content and raw design speak for themselves.

## Inspiration
Inspired by Brutalist design principles and a passion for tech, it reflects my approach as a developer: grounded in structure, yet open to creative breaks in pattern. Here, every "glitch" is a feature, each detail crafted to leave an impression.
